# stripe-shop

# to run
`cd stripe-shop`  
`npm run start`  

# to create angular 13 app locally w/o installing CLI globaly
`npx -p @angular/cli@14.2.2 ng new stripe-shop --routing --minimal`  
  
I was not able to run this in new version of node (18.13.0, 19.5.0 - these versions of node are too new for angular 14), I had to use `16.13.2`.
